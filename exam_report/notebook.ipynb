I have validated all the columns against the criteria in the dataset table:\n\n- week: this column contains integer values ranging from 1 to 6, representing each week. It has no missing values, so no modifications were required.\n- sales_method: initially contained 5 unique values ('Email', 'Call', 'Email + Call', 'email', 'em + call') due to inconsistent labeling. These were corrected by standardizing capitalization and spacing, ensuring consistency, and mapping incorrect values to their proper categories, resulting in 3 final categories ('Email', 'Call', 'Email + Call'), with no missing values. Valid after cleaning.\n- customer_id: character values without missing values, unique per customer, as expected. Checked for duplicates‚Äînone found. Data integrity maintained. No cleaning is needed.\n- nb_sold: numeric values without missing values, same as the description. All values are positive and within an expected range. No cleaning is needed.\n- revenue: numeric values with 1074 missing values, which were filled by multiplying the median revenue per unit sold by nb_sold for each sales method to ensure accurate and consistent revenue distribution.Valid after imputation.\n- years_as_customer: numeric values without missing values, but 2 rows contained invalid entries. Since the company was founded in 1984, the maximum possible value should be 41 years. However, two records had values of 47 and 63 years, which are impossible. To ensure data accuracy, these two rows were removed from the dataset.\n- nb_site_visits: numeric values without missing values, same as the description. All values fall within a reasonable range. No changes were necessary.\n- state: 50 unique states without missing values, same as the description. Checked for inconsistencies‚Äînone found. No changes were necessary.\n\nAfter the data validation, the dataset contains **14,998 rows and 8 columns**, ensuring accuracy, consistency, and completeness for analysis.\n\n\n","metadata":{},"id":"c22f7f5b-2a69-4515-8b29-7b0e94829f11","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## How Many Customers Were There for Each Approach?\nAs we can see from the countplot, Email had the highest number of customers, with approximately 7,500 transactions, nearly 1.5 times more than Call (around 5,000 transactions) and three times more than Email + Call (just over 2,500 transactions). While Email attracts the most customers, it does not necessarily generate the highest revenue per transaction.\n\n![customer_count](customer_count.png)\n\n## What Does the Spread of Revenue Look Like Overall?\nThe histogram reveals that most transactions generate revenue between \\$50 and \\$120, while fewer transactions exceed \\$230. The revenue distribution is slightly right-skewed, meaning a small number of transactions contribute significantly more revenue than the majority. Understanding these high-revenue transactions is crucial for maximizing profitability.\n\n![revenue_distribution](revenue_distribution.png)\n\n## What Does the Spread of Revenue Look Like for Each Method?\nAs shown in the box plot, Email + Call has the highest median revenue per transaction at approximately \\$185 and the widest revenue range, indicating a large variation in revenue per sale. This makes it almost twice as profitable as Email (\\$95 per transaction) and nearly four times higher than Call (just below \\$50). This confirms that Email + Call delivers the most value per sale, while also showing opportunities to optimize high-revenue transactions.\n\n![revenue_by_method](revenue_by_method.png)\n\n## Was There Any Difference in Revenue Over Time for Each Method?\nThe line chart demonstrates how Email starts strong in Week 1 but declines steadily and does not recover. Call grows gradually, reaching its peak in Week 5, but drops afterward. Email + Call also peaks in Week 5 but maintains higher revenue after its peak, making it the most stable and profitable method long-term.\n\n![revenue_over_time](revenue_over_time.png)","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"bac177ec-a828-4e16-92c9-a18339745942"},{"source":"## Based on the Data, Which Sales Method Should We Continue to Use?\nAs we can see from the bar chart, Email generated the highest total revenue, over \\$700K, which is approximately three times that of Call (almost \\$250K). Meanwhile, Email + Call, despite having fewer customers, still contributed over \\$450K, proving its efficiency in generating high-value transactions. Call has the lowest total revenue, reinforcing its lower effectiveness. However, total revenue alone does not determine the best method, as revenue efficiency per customer is equally important.\n\n![total_revenue](total_revenue.png)\n\nThe bar chart below confirms that Email + Call generates the highest revenue per customer at over \\$180, making it almost double that of Email (around \\$95 per customer) and nearly four times higher than Call (around \\$45 per customer).

This metric provides a clearer understanding of revenue efficiency by showing how much each customer contributes to overall sales. By tracking this metric, the company can identify the most valuable sales approach and optimize its strategy accordingly. The initial estimates suggest that Email + Call generates the highest revenue per customer, making it the most effective method. Call has potential but lacks consistency, while Email, despite attracting the most customers, has lower revenue per customer.
